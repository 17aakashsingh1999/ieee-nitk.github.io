Having a few projects related to music processing in mind, I decided to learn more about Signal Processing. With the recent boom in Machine Learning applications in SP, I realized that there were a lot of problem statements which could be taken up even at the B.Tech level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having developed this interest in SP, I decided to...</description>
