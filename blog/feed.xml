        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;vortices&quot;&gt;Vortices&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;When everything seems to be going against you, remember that an airplane takes off against the wind, not with it&lt;/em&gt;” – Henry Ford&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article has been written especially for those who are interested in aerodynamics and also for people who are curious to know how small modifications in design help make an airplane or a car more aerodynamically efficient. The content is from an aerodynamic point of view, in an airflow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/vortices/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fig.1&quot; title=&quot;Fig.1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A Vortex (Fig. 1) is nothing but a region in a fluid which revolves about a certain axis.

        <title>Light backscatter application</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;measure-of-fat-content-in-milk-with-led-and-ldr&quot;&gt;Measure of fat content in milk with LED and LDR&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India's milk production&lt;/strong&gt; is estimated to have increased by 6.6 per cent during the last four year. Price of milk is based on the quantity of FAT present in milk . so we need machine which can measures milk parameters like SNF (Solid but Not FAT), FAT, CLR, with less cost.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The important thing is that machine should be cheaper and only based on electricity .then it is very helpful for the remote area also.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming to the point photometric based sensor or light backscatter application technique is able...</description>

        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-you-need-gpu&quot;&gt;Why you need GPU&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;You’ve probably wanted to buy a laptop/desktop with a GPU to play those awesome high graphics games that your friends keep talking about, and yes your parents wouldv’e probably said “You’re not going to get that. You need to study now”. But is that all the use there is for a GPU?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;gpu-vs-cpu&quot;&gt;GPU vs CPU&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yeah we all know what they stand for, so let’s skip that and get a little technical.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/why-you-need-gpu/cpuvsgpu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GPUvsCPU&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To put it in one line, we can say that if the CPU is being used for computations,...</description>

        <title>Automate The Industries</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;automate-the-industries&quot;&gt;Automate The Industries&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industrial Automation refers to the use of sensors, robots , actuators in various industrial processes so that we get much better efficiency and the working labour required is low. Although the initial cost of setup of an automated industry is high, but the industrialists will surely be in profit if they apply the automation method as they can produce more no of goods in a limited time and also the quality of their products will increase as the human error in production is minimised.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here are some of the industrial processes in which we can use...</description>

        <title>Why Machine Learning Matters ?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hello everyone !&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This article is for people who want a primer on &lt;em&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/em&gt; and anyone who is curious about how Machines think.If you are already familiar with ML, this may not be the right place for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;why-machine-learning-matters-&quot;&gt;Why Machine Learning matters ?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; will shape our future more powerfully than any other innovation this century. The rate of acceleration is already astounding. After a couple of AI winters and periods of false hope over the past four decades, rapid advances in data storage and computer processing power have dramatically changed the game in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In...</description>

        <title>Phase Change Material</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A Phase Change Material (PCM) is a substance with a high heat of fusion which, on melting and solidifying at a certain temperature, is capable of storing and releasing large amounts of energy. In the most basic terms, a PCM is a substance which can store and release large amounts of energy, typically in the form of heat. Although phase changes can occur among any combination of the three phases of a substance - gas, liquid, or solid - the most commercially viable transition is between the liquid and solid phases.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;working-of-a-pcm&quot;&gt;Working of a PCM&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A PCM in its’...</description>

        <title>Avionics</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The merging of the words aviation and electronics, Avionics are all of the electronic devices and systems which perform individualized functions, used on any aircraft. Whether it is a military standard drone or a small hobby craft, it contains many electronic components which together achieve controlled flight. In this blog I’m going to talk mainly on the electronics aspect of the equipment used in small scale aircraft and drones.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;accelerometer&quot;&gt;Accelerometer&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/avionics/Accelerometer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Accelerometer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/avionics/AccelerometerIC.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Accelometer IC&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An accelerometer is a transducer that is used to measure the physical or measurable acceleration that is made by an...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Segment trees are extensivly used in competitive programming for problems that invlove range queries and range updates.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, given an array A of N elements, answer Q queries (of two types):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1 L R : output the sum of elements between L and R&lt;br /&gt; 2 x I : A[I] = x&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A similar version of the above problem for minimum(i.e. to find the minimum between L and R) is famously known as Range Minimum Query. These problems can be easily solved with segment trees.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;naive-approach&quot;&gt;Naive Approach&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A naive approach would be to answer...</description>
