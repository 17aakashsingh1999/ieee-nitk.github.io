        <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;honeycomb-conjecture&quot;&gt;Honeycomb Conjecture&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do bees build &lt;strong&gt;hexagonal structured&lt;/strong&gt; hives? Why not any other shape? Let us deliberate these questions which troubled many thinkers. &lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/the-honeycomb-conjecture/img1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;img1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consider prisms of different regular polygons and assume them to have same height and volume. This means that the one with the &lt;strong&gt;least&lt;/strong&gt; perimeter will require the least material to build. We know that as we increase number of sides in the polygon, perimeter decreases. So, cylinder will use the least amount of material (circle can be considered as a polygon with infinite sides).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But cylinders are economical only if they stand...</description>

        <title>Charge your phone whenever you walk into the room</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;charge-your-phone-whenever&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHARGE YOUR PHONE WHENEVER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;you-walk-into-the-room&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YOU WALK INTO THE ROOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One quick and easy way to induce anxiety is to misplace your phone charger. You’re stressed out just thinking about it right now, well what if instead of dealing with your wiry bundles and ports and mats and plugs and cords, you could just….walk into a room and automatically your mobile phones, laptops any other appliances get charged. However, mobile devices are not truly mobile if they require connection to power cord.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wi-charge technology provides us finally a way to get rid of the power cord, efficiently and safely....</description>

        <title>Augmented Reality</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you have played “Pokémon Go” or not, you’ve probably at least heard of the game. A special app on your smartphone or tablet makes it look like Pokémon is right there in front of you  while you search for and “capture” the different characters.  This game aquainted the world with this fast growing technology Augmented Reality. This new technology, blurs the line between what’s real and what’s computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-does-augmented-reality-work&quot;&gt;How does Augmented Reality work&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light. This is...</description>

        <title>The Brain behind a Formula One Car</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The track belongs to the driver, the pits belong to the engineers&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Formula One cars are mean machines. They have been fine tuned for one purpose- Speed. In fact, they are the most efficient mode of transport after space shuttles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Be it aerodynamic performance, super-efficient engines or state of the art tyre management strategies, engineers have scaled new heights in their pursuit for speed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-ecu&quot;&gt;The ECU:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, one aspect of the car that goes largely unnoticed is the electrical system. If the chassis and the engine form the arms and legs, &lt;strong&gt;the Electronic Control Unit&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;the...</description>

        <title>Robots Can Now See In 3D</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous robots can inspect nuclear power plants, clean up oil spills in the ocean, accompany fighter planes into combat and explore the surface of Mars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet for all their talents, robots still can’t make a cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That’s because tasks such as turning the stove on, fetching the kettle and finding the milk and sugar require perceptual abilities that, for most machines, are still a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among them is the ability to make sense of 3-D objects. While it’s relatively straightforward for robots to “see” objects with cameras and other sensors, interpreting what they see, from a single glimpse,...</description>

        <title>Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last 2 years, &lt;strong&gt;Generative Models&lt;/strong&gt; have been one of the most active areas of research in the field of Deep Learning. The paper on &lt;strong&gt;Generative Adversarial Networks&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a GANs) published by &lt;strong&gt;Ian Goodfellow&lt;/strong&gt; in 2014 triggered a new wave of research in the field of Generative Models. Today we’ll explore what makes GANs so different and interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/GAN/ideal-gen-model.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Ideal Generative Model&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The main objective of a Generative Model is to learn the &lt;em&gt;probability distribution&lt;/em&gt; from which the training data is sampled. Once the model learns the probability distribution, it can sample new data from...</description>

But , how can this be done ?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;SEO i.e. Search Engine Optimisation&lt;/strong&gt; comes into play.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/SEO/gif.gif&quot; alt=&quot;SEO and Ranking&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a world where &lt;strong&gt;over 90% of online experiences start with a search engine,&lt;/strong&gt; showing up on the front page of Google Search can...</description>

        <title>Raspberry Pi Tutorial</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have just started exploring microcontrollers and experimenting with development boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, you might have had struggles with configuring the board and interfacing them with the hardware that you used to build your little fascinating circuits. I too, faced some issues when I had to set up my Raspberry Pi B+ model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most of the instructables available online give instructions for working with a separate monitor connected to RPi using a HDMI cable. However, to make things convenient, you can use your laptop display itself to work with your Rpi. This requires a few additional...</description>

        <title>Aircraft Engines</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Many of you might have flown in an aircraft at least once in your lifetime and even if you haven’t, you might have at least seen one in a picture. You might have noticed that there are different types of aircraft for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some are small and can accommodate only 5 people while some are huge and can carry more than 600 people, some are used for dropping bombs while some others are used for rescuing people during disasters.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of the most essential parts of any of these aircrafts is the engine. The engine provides the thrust required...</description>

        <title>Fingerprint Recognition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fingerprint recognition systems are practically everywhere today, from your smartphone, laptops, and are an integral part of the Aadhar system enabling us to authenticate our identity easily. Here’s a look at how the whole system of fingerprint recognition works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingerprints are the tiny friction ridges on the ends of our fingers and thumbs make it easier to grip things. By making our fingers rougher, these ridges increase the force of friction between our hands and the objects we hold, making it harder to drop things. Unless you have accidents with your hands, your fingerprints remain the same throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;...</description>
