        <title>Bit Manipulation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;All data in computer programs is internally stored as bits, i.e., as numbers 0 and 1. It turns out that there are many uses for bit manipulation in competitive programming.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In programming, an n bit integer is internally stored as a binary number that consists of n bits. For example, the C++ type int is a 32-bit type, which means that every int number consists of 32 bits. For exmaple, the bit representation of the int number 42 is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;00000000000000000000000000101010&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several bit operations supported by a typical ALU, some of them being AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and...</description>

        <title>Fluids and Satellites</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The increasingly large volumes of fluid that have to be carried aboard satellites designed for long operating lifetimes, but which often must also deliver high-accuracy pointing, mean that special attention has to be paid to the behavior of fluids in low gravity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;low-gravity-and-fluid-dynamics&quot;&gt;Low gravity and fluid dynamics&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are several methods for analyzing the dynamic behavior of fluids under normal gravity conditions on Earth. A common assumption in such methods is that the free surface of the fluid is flat and at right angles to the direction in which gravity is acting, i.e. normal to the gravity vector.

        <title>How is Technology Helping the Differently Abled People?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, the government of India dedicated the National Science Day to the theme “Science and Technology for specially-abled people”. The main aim was to encourage innovation and also to ease the difficulties of differently abled people. So here are 10 assistive technologies to assist them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;devices-for-people-with-visual-impairment&quot;&gt;Devices for people with visual Impairment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;dot&quot;&gt;DOT&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first Braille smart watch which is affordable compared to the regular e-Braille devices. Technically this device consists of 6 dots on four cells on the screen of the watch which forms 4 letters in Braille at any time. This tool helps...</description>

        <title>How do websites communicate securely?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The inherent need for human beings has always been to communicate and share information,albeit selectively. For this purpose, the information is to be coded in such a way that it can be deciphered only by the recipient, regardless of whether the recipient is right next to the sender or on the other side of the world. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The communication channel is assumed to be plagued with adversaries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.These adversaries have access to this coded information and are constantly trying to pry.So, the basic problem has always been to: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;transfer secure information over such insecure channels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, how DO you communicate when everyone...</description>

This would go on to be known as the ‘War of the Currents’.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 1880, Edison had created a model for the incandescent lamp that was commercially viable. But to make a profit out of the electric lights that...</description>

        <title>Speed Printing</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;3D printing technology is often used to construct highly complex objects of different kinds, properties and materials. Despite its numerous advantages, one major drawback of 3D printers is its traditionally slow speed. This is where it fails miserably, in its large scale applicability, against other major manufacturing processes like injection moulding. To overcome this major industry challenge, several 3D companies have come up with more updated and efficient technologies that guarantee quick speeds and utmost accuracy. One of the successful and modern technology is &lt;strong&gt;CLIP (short for, continuous liquid interface production)&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A typical 3D printing machine such...</description>

        <title>The E INK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with talking about the screen you’re currently glaring at to read this article. If you don’t scroll down then the screen is pretty much static right? Not really. Behind the screen, all the pixels controlling what you see is getting multiplexed so fast that our eyes make it out as a constant one. Basically, a word is constantly consuming energy just to remain onscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you write a word on paper, does it need any more energy to remain on the paper? No. It remains there forever. This is the basic idea behind E Ink. Energy should only...</description>

        <title>The Rocker-Bogie Mechanism</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Everyone might know what a rover is. It is a space exploration device designed to move across the surface of celestial bodies. Have you ever wondered how these rovers are capable of traversing the rough and rocky terrains of a planet? Different kinds of suspension systems are employed to help them achieve this task. Rocker-Bogie is one such suspensionsystem which is very popular and widely used. It is currently NASA’s favoured design for wheeled mobile rovers. NASA’s Curiosity rover uses this mechanism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;design--features&quot;&gt;Design &amp;amp; Features&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/rocker-bogie/image1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;346&quot; height=&quot;174&quot; alt=&quot;Rocker Bogie&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest link on each...</description>

        <title>The Future of Computing: Quantum Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, you must been hearing a lot about quantum computing. There are loads of news stories about how it “could change the world” and “open new dimensions”. Universities are hyping up their quantum microchip prototypes, demonstrations of quantum mechanical ideas in silicon, and other devices and theories. But how does it work? What does it do? Who’s doing it? Read this article to find out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though they may be fragile today as well as they need to be kept at temperatures close to absolute zero, Quantum computers aren’t much like the desktop PCs we’re all so familiar with—they’re a...</description>
