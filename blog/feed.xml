        <title>How NASA discovered planets using Artificial Intelligence</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Convolutional Neural Network.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;A Convolutional Neural Network and 90 minutes of training.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clearly, the hard part wasn’t the training or the model but to get the &lt;em&gt;training set&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; But what is the &lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;? and where did we get it form?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;On December 14, 2017 NASA &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/artificial-intelligence-nasa-data-used-to-discover-eighth-planet-circling-distant-star&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the discovery of an eigth planet in the &lt;em&gt;Kepler-90&lt;/em&gt; system. &lt;em&gt;Kepler-90&lt;/em&gt; is a Sun-like star 2545 light-years from Earth. The discovery was made using Artificial Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h3 id=&quot;where-did-the-data-come-from&quot;&gt;Where did the data come from?&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;NASA has this huge camera up in space that has been sending us videos of...</description>

        <title>The E INK</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THE E INK&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with talking about the screen you’re currently glaring at to read this article. If you don’t scroll down then the screen is pretty much static right? Not really. Behind the screen, all the pixels controlling what you see is getting multiplexed so fast that our eyes make it out as a constant one. Basically, a word is constantly consuming energy just to remain onscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you write a word on paper, does it need any more energy to remain on the paper? No. It remains there forever. This is the basic idea behind E Ink....</description>

        <title>The Future of Computing: Quantum Computing</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Lately, you must been hearing a lot about quantum computing. There are loads of news stories about how it “could change the world” and “open new dimensions”. Universities are hyping up their quantum microchip prototypes, demonstrations of quantum mechanical ideas in silicon, and other devices and theories. But how does it work? What does it do? Who’s working on it? Read this article to find out!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even though they may be fragile today as well as they need to be kept at temperatures close to absolute zero, Quantum computers aren’t much like the desktop PCs we’re all so familiar with—they’re...</description>

        <title>Airbag System for two Wheeler vehicles</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Airbag system was first introduced in 4-wheelers . This paper gives information about the introduction of the airbag system can be used in the two wheelers(bikes). This paper shows the working, construction, installation of this system and problems that can occur in this system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The concept of this airbag system is “To reduce the injuries to a rider when impacting with an opposing vehicle and/or opposing object in frontal collisions by absorbing rider kinetic energy and by reducing rider separation velocity from motorcycle in the forward direction.” With the help of the ANGLE sensor with an angle...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;botnet-of-things&quot;&gt;Botnet of things&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Internet of Things aka IoT is one of the hot trending topics in the tech world right now. The IoT is basically a network of devices connected to the internet, each having a unique IP address. Today, the Internet of Things plays with the idea of connecting nearly every manufactured object to the Internet. It is being incorporated into smart homes, watches, cars, fitness trackers, power grids, thermostats, contact lenses, pacemakers and what not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the Internet of Things brings a new horizon of opportunities, there are several barriers in respect to making IoT implementations...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello to all the computer enthusiasts out there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this article,we will look into a simple C program intended to perform a particular task is MADE to perform a task it was not supposed to perform. SO,WE WILL BE TRYING TO FOOL THE COMPUTER!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;pre-requisites-&quot;&gt;Pre-requisites :&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;A computer which runs Linux.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A curious mind which wants to know how stuff actually works!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;We will be using GDB(GNU Debugger) to understand the C program at the assembly level.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If GDB is not installed in your box,you can type in this command to install it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sudo...</description>

        <title>Radio Frequency Identification</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;RFID technology has been in circulation for many years now. You may have encountered it first-hand while borrowing library books, or while swiping for attendance in school. Recently, the government issued RFID chips to be installed in cars so that we can zoom through toll booths instead of waiting in long queues. RFID technology has also got a fair share of screen time. Remember Casino Royale? Her Majesty’s Secret Service injects Bond with a glass-enclosed, rice-sized RFID chip, so that, in M’s words, “they’ll know where he is”. Here is a little insight into the technology that is taking the world by...</description>

        <title>Machine Learning for Stock Market Investment</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Arthur Lee Samuel, the man who coined the term “machine learning” defined it as the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;A good analogy to how it actually works would be teaching a child to play chess by locking him in a room with nothing but the rules of the game and a record of say, a hundred previous games (and of course, food and water). After a period of five days, the child would walk out of the room as a pretty good chess player. In our analogy, the...</description>

        <title>Evacuated Tube Collectors</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is the key for the planet’s existence in the future. The fossil fuels are non-renewable and require finite resources, which are dwindling because of high cost and environmentally damaging retrieval techniques. Climate change is real. Global warming is real. It took some time to accept this hard fact, but now with the realization, production of clean energy has become the primary goal of countries across all continents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Great amount of research is carried in improving the efficiency of renewable energy and making it inexpensive. The main objective is to minimize or eliminate the usage of electricity...</description>

        <title>The Halting Problem</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have written computer codes, then you certainly would have fallen into the trap of infinite loops. Then you might have wondered if there is an algorithm to check if any given computer program runs into an infinite loop or not; in other words, to check if it halts or not. How wonderful it would be if such an algorithm exists! But alas, the truth is that there is no such algorithm, not because no one has found such an algorithm yet, but because there is no way of finding such an algorithm ever.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;halting problem&lt;/strong&gt;...</description>
