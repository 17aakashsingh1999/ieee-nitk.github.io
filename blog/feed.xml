        <title>Fingerprint Recognition</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Fingerprint recognition systems are practically everywhere today, from your smartphone, laptops, and are an integral part of the Aadhar system enabling us to authenticate our identity easily. Here’s a look at how the whole system of fingerprint recognition works.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Fingerprints are the tiny friction ridges on the ends of our fingers and thumbs make it easier to grip things. By making our fingers rougher, these ridges increase the force of friction between our hands and the objects we hold, making it harder to drop things. Unless you have accidents with your hands, your fingerprints remain the same throughout your life.&lt;/p&gt;...</description>

        <title>The Intriguing World of Chatbots</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;﻿&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey Siri, What’s my schedule for today”&lt;br /&gt; “Hey Cortana, when is my appointment with the dentist today”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are a few phrases that we use casually from day to day in order to make our life a tad bit easier. In this time of rapid advances in AI and Machine learning Chatbots are one avenue that has been ushered into reality by this magical paradigm that has been growing by leaps and bounds in the past few years. But what if Chatbots can be a vital link in another field that is rapidly gaining traction, namely...</description>

        <title>Biohacking</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;﻿Ever fantasied becoming the Cyborg from DC comics universe? Well, brace yourself, because that dream is soon to come into reality.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Introducing Biohacking, a fairly new practice that could bring major changes in human life as we know it. Biohacking can be defined as a “social movement involving studying basic biology and exploiting it to make electronic implants made using easily available equipment”. In short, you make a cyborg out of yourself. As “punk” as it sounds, this practice caught the attention of media because of the possibilities it opens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/biohacking/1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RFID chip&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ron Shigeta&lt;/strong&gt; runs Berkeley Biolabs,...</description>

        <title>Getting Started with GUIs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While learning a programming language, there’s often a question of how simple problem solving using code is going to help us create software we see around us. The fact is that software engineering requires a lot more skills as a programmer. And a good first step to creating software is to learn how to create graphical user interfaces, commonly referred to as GUIs. In this article, we’ll learn how to get started with creating GUIs in C using a toolkit known as GTK+.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-guis&quot;&gt;What are &lt;em&gt;GUIs&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the graphical user interface, is a type of user interface...</description>

        <title>The Challenger Disaster</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1986, the scheduled launch for NASA’s space orbiter- the Challenger, took place as planned. But the launch was the only part of the mission that stuck to plan. 73 seconds after liftoff, the shuttle exploded and broke up, bringing a devastating end to the spacecraft’s 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mission, claiming all 7 lives onboard. All because of a tiny, rather overlooked aspect of a structure failing due to a very basic property of the given material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After extensive failure analysis, it was determined that the failure of 2 rubber O-rings caused the disaster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand why the...</description>

However, many people do not even know what BitTorrent is, much less know how it works.(It includes uploading files as well)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-simple-introduction&quot;&gt;A simple introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/BitTorrent-Explained/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;BitTorrent Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BitTorrent is a communication protocol(set of rules) that is used for sharing all types of data and electronic files over the internet. This falls under the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer file sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now,...</description>

        <title>Storing energy in molten salt</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is the answer to sustainable development. It is the hot topic of our generation and even though it is in its rudimentary stage, it is the best solution in maintaining the balance between environment and our energy needs. We all know that a lot of research is going on in this field, whether it is the oft talked about and used solar and wind energy, or the slightly less used ocean thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, what do you do after you produce this energy? What if it is in excess to your current need? You need to...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you leave your home have you been bothered by these little doubts like have I turned the water heater off? Did I set the security at home? Did I switch off the TV?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of smart homes these will no longer be a bother to us anymore. Any electrical component, may it be a fan or your TV or even your coffee maker, every electrical appliance in our homes can be hooked up to the home network. This will basically allow us to control our entire house with our laptops or something as simple as...</description>

        <title>You don't really know Arduino</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is he kiddin? Well I am not (just be patient enough to reach the end). Arduino is a very good platform to start making &lt;strong&gt;witty&lt;/strong&gt; electronics projects instead of dumb L.E.D blinking circuits (apologies to the 555) but after some time electronic hobbyists loose interest due to one or more of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is too simple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It’s performance is limited&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It does not feels like embedded programming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There is a library for literally everything (sounds like an advantage?)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well the amount of abstraction Arduino offers hides vital details of the micro-controller that powers the board. “&lt;em&gt;It...</description>
