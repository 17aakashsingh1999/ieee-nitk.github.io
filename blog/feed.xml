        <title>The Intriguing World of Chatbots</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;﻿&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 id=&quot;the-intriguing-world-of-chatbots&quot;&gt;The Intriguing World of Chatbots&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Hey Siri, What’s my schedule for today”&lt;br /&gt; “Hey Cortana, when is my appointment with the dentist today”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are a few phrases that we use casually from day to day in order to make our life a tad bit easier. In this time of rapid advances in AI and Machine learning Chatbots are one avenue that has been ushered into reality by this magical paradigm that has been growing by leaps and bounds in the past few years. But what if Chatbots can be a vital link in another field...</description>

        <title>Getting Started with GUIs</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While learning a programming language, there’s often a question of how simple problem solving using code is going to help us create software we see around us. The fact is that software engineering requires a lot more skills as a programmer. And a good first step to creating software is to learn how to create graphical user interfaces, commonly referred to as GUIs. In this article, we’ll learn how to get started with creating GUIs in C using a toolkit known as GTK+.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;what-are-guis&quot;&gt;What are &lt;em&gt;GUIs&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to Wikipedia, the graphical user interface, is a type of user interface...</description>

        <title>The Challenger Disaster</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;On January 28&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; 1986, the scheduled launch for NASA’s space orbiter- the Challenger, took place as planned. But the launch was the only part of the mission that stuck to plan. 73 seconds after liftoff, the shuttle exploded and broke up, bringing a devastating end to the spacecraft’s 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; mission, claiming all 7 lives onboard. All because of a tiny, rather overlooked aspect of a structure failing due to a very basic property of the given material.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After extensive failure analysis, it was determined that the failure of 2 rubber O-rings caused the disaster.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To understand why the...</description>

        <title>BitTorrent Explained</title>
        <description>&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Just torrent it!”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“You can torrent any type of file, its all there on the internet…”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;These are just some of the common sentences one hears when it comes to downloading files from the internet. However, many people do not even know what BitTorrent is, much less know how it works.(It includes uploading files as well)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;a-simple-introduction&quot;&gt;A simple introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/img/BitTorrent-Explained/pic1.png&quot; alt=&quot;BitTorrent Logo&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;BitTorrent is a communication protocol(set of rules) that is used for sharing all types of data and electronic files over the internet. This falls under the category of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer_file_sharing&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer file sharing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now,...</description>

        <title>Storing energy in molten salt</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Renewable energy is the answer to sustainable development. It is the hot topic of our generation and even though it is in its rudimentary stage, it is the best solution in maintaining the balance between environment and our energy needs. We all know that a lot of research is going on in this field, whether it is the oft talked about and used solar and wind energy, or the slightly less used ocean thermal energy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But, what do you do after you produce this energy? What if it is in excess to your current need? You need to...</description>

        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you leave your home have you been bothered by these little doubts like have I turned the water heater off? Did I set the security at home? Did I switch off the TV?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With the introduction of smart homes these will no longer be a bother to us anymore. Any electrical component, may it be a fan or your TV or even your coffee maker, every electrical appliance in our homes can be hooked up to the home network. This will basically allow us to control our entire house with our laptops or something as simple as...</description>

        <title>You don't really know Arduino</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Is he kiddin? Well I am not (just be patient enough to reach the end). Arduino is a very good platform to start making &lt;strong&gt;witty&lt;/strong&gt; electronics projects instead of dumb L.E.D blinking circuits (apologies to the 555) but after some time electronic hobbyists loose interest due to one or more of the following reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;It is too simple&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It’s performance is limited&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;It does not feels like embedded programming&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;There is a library for literally everything (sounds like an advantage?)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Well the amount of abstraction Arduino offers hides vital details of the micro-controller that powers the board. “&lt;em&gt;It...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;What would you preferably use to store your precious data - a hard disk, a pen-drive, a DVD; or perhaps WATER!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Scientists from Germany now believe that water has a memory, meaning that what once was seen as a simple commodity has been closely examined to reveal a scientific revelation, uncovering a mind-blowing truth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;theory&quot;&gt;Theory&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Individual drops of water from the same sample were examined at incredibly high magnification, probably the first experiment of this kind and surprisingly scientists were able to physically see that each droplet of water has its own &lt;em&gt;individual microscopic pattern,&lt;/em&gt; distinguishable from the next...</description>

        <title>Rock Paper Scissors</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;If you have ever played the game of rock, paper scissors I bet that the best strategy you had was trying to predict your opponent’s move which is a pretty appealing idea. But given that it is nigh impossible to do that (unless, of course, you can read minds), is that really a sound strategy to adopt? If you think about it in a rational way there is no method to predict your opponent and basing your strategy on such an unpredictable thing is kind of dumb. I think the best approach to this problem is to make sure your...</description>
