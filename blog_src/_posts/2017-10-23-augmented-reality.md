Whether you have played “Pokémon Go” or not, you’ve probably at least heard of the game. A special app on your smartphone or tablet makes it look like Pokémon is right there in front of you  while you search for and “capture” the different characters.  This game aquainted the world with this fast growing technology Augmented Reality. This new technology, blurs the line between what's real and what's computer-generated by enhancing what we see, hear, feel and smell.

## How does Augmented Reality work

In most augmented reality applications, a user will see both synthetic and natural light. This is done by overlaying projected images on top of a pair of see-through goggles or glasses, which allow the images and **interactive virtual objects** to layer on top of the user's view of the real world.

## Key Components to Augmented Reality devices

### Sensors and Cameras
Sensors are usually on the outside of the augmented reality device, and gather a user's real world interactions and communicate them to be processed and interpreted. Cameras are also located on the outside of the device, and visually scan to collect data about the surrounding area.

### Projectors
A projector is a device that can essentially turn any surface maybe a wall or even a person into an interactive environment.

### Reflectors
Mirrors are used in augmented reality devices to assist with the way your eye views the virtual image.

### Processors
Augmented reality devices are basically mini-supercomputers packed into tiny wearable devices.They contain  components like a CPU, a GPU, flash memory, RAM, Bluetooth and more.

## Real World Examples of Social Media Apps Using Augmented Reality

### Snapchat

> The most popular and ephemeral messaging app is the first name in this high-tech world of Augmented Reality. Founders of this globally used social media app, namely Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy and Reggie Brown, aimed for more natural flow of interaction.

### Facebook

>Facebook believes that consumer-ready Augmented Reality glasses are bit far from everyday use, but instant and ready-to-use AR devices exist right in our pockets.

## Future of Augmented Reality

AR may completely revamp how we navigate the world, both indoors and outdoors. Imagine seeing directions before you throughout Walmart to find the laundry detergent you were looking for. It can also help eCommerce shoppers try products at home before they purchase. 
In the future, all stores will feature 3D models that can be seen in your very room with a click of a button. See how the lamp you want to buy would look in your living room through AR, or the queen size bed that you don’t think will fit in your bedroom.
