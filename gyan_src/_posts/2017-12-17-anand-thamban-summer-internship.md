My research interests include Fluid mechanics, Wind energy and Heat Transfer. Areas I've worked on are: Energy Harvesting form wind turbines, performance enhancement of hydro-kinetic turbine hydrofoils, and condensation on super hydrophobic heat exchangers.

## Where did you get your internship and why did you apply there? 
### What interested you or attracted you to this particular internship and why?

I did my internship at the Energy Transport Research Lab, Mechanical Engineering Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. A few seniors of mine had worked in the same lab. They have some cutting edge research going on in condensation and frosting heat transfer on superhydrophobic surfaces. 

## How did you get your internship? 
### Was it through the college or off-campus or through a senior/prof or through an internship website?

A senior recommended the professor to me. I emailed him personally.

## What was your internship about?

I worked on two projects. One was about studying the effects of fin spacing on jumping droplet dynamics and the other was on jumping droplet enhanced condensation on super-hydrophobic heat exchangers.

## How was the work culture?
### Was it challenging for you to do it? What new skills did you develop?

Work culture was very flexible. The lab I worked in had flexible timings. As long as the objective was achieved it didn't matter. You could sleep in the morning and work in the night as well!

## What did you learn during the internship? 
### Was it challenging for you to do it? What new skills did you develop?

My work was mostly experimental, so I was involved in designing the whole setup for future work. Experimental work can get stressful if you cannot find out solutions to problems. It is mostly observing the problems carefully and bringing all your core engineering knowledge to solve major problems. It was challenging, yes. This kind of work is something you wont do in India. The exposure is brilliant.

I will be the co-author of a research paper to be published in December, 2017.

## Tell us about the fun/ interesting incidents during the course of your internship.

Most of the time I used to hang out with my lab mates and guide. We used to go for drives, trekking, movies etc.

## What advice would you give to juniors regarding your internship?
### Would you recommend a junior undergoing a similar internship at the same place you went?

If anyone is interested in material science, nano/micro fabrication of silicon, heat transfer, then this a good lab to apply to. But you would not receive any stipend and the processing fee is quite high. If you are okay with shelling out some money then this is a good opportunity. It's good investment.
