I am interested in Systems and Security, mainly involving Cryptography, Distributed and Operating Systems, Blockchains and Quantum Computing.

## Where did you get your internship and why did you apply there? 
### What interested you or attracted you to this particular internship and why?

Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata. <br>
I applied here because it is one of the few places in the country where cryptographic research takes place. Also it has some of the country's best cryptographers.

## How did you get your internship? 
### Was it through the college or off-campus or through a senior/prof or through an internship website?

I emailed a Professor and she scheduled a telephonic interview with me. After the interview she arranged the internship and all the associated paperworks for me. 

## What was your internship about?

I worked on building a data storage framework using a modified Ethereum protocol.

## How was the work culture?

The office timings were very relaxed. Students are allowed to work 24x7. The work was target based. The big picture was explained and the guide suggests the general approach. Students are expected to learn the requisites, implement them and come up with new ideas. It was a great learning experience. The atmosphere is conducive for learning. Research scholars discuss about the latest technologies, research areas such as quantum computing, block chains, data base security, information theory, Homomorphic encryption, etc. 

## What did you learn during the internship? 
### Was it challenging for you to do it? What new skills did you develop?

It was a very demanding project. I had to read a lot of research papers to become up-to-date with the latest research in the field of block chains. But once the initial learning phase was completed, the rest of the project sailed like a breeze. The discussions held with the other research scholars helped me learn a lot about quantum computing, blockchains and deep learning. The students were allowed to participate in a blockchain workshop and also attend IndoCrypt 2017. This exposure is critical and helped the students to grasp the cutting edge research in blockchains and cryptography respectively.

I had to implement a modified go-ethereum client which follows a modified ethereum protocol. The protocol enables the users to have publicly verifiable decentralized storage using blockchains.

## Tell us about the fun/ interesting incidents during the course of your internship.

I was fully funded to visit IndoCrypt 2017, held at Chennai. Here we met research heads from Microsoft and TCS. I was also a part of a blockchain workshop held at ISI. We met several key government officials, professors who advised the Prime Minister of India. We met India research heads of IBM and Microsoft. We also met distinguished internation professors from Japan and Belgium apart from the distinguished professors from IITB, IIT-Kanpur, IITD, etc.

## What advice would you give to juniors regarding your internship?
### Would you recommend a junior undergoing a similar internship at the same place you went?

I definitely recommend students interested in quantum computing, information theory, cryptography to try securing an internship in ISI Kolkata.
