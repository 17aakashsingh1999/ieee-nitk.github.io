  "description": "Envision is a platform for the IEEE NITK Student Branch members where innovative ideas are proposed in various diverse fields and members work on them with funding available through the student branch. We aim to provide opportunity to the first year student members of IEEE NITK to work on projects through this event with involvement of 1 or 2, 2nd year Executive members along with the first years to guide them. This is a year- long event. A Google form is rolled out as soon as student membership drive happens in the odd semester and the projects begin from January and are allowed to go on till December before the student membership of that candidate proposing the idea expires. The projects through Envision will have reviews (possibly 2 reviews in each semester) by the respective SIG to which the project is related to. Active participation from all SIGs is highly encouraged.",
