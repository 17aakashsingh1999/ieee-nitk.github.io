  "description": "<p>It is an initiative by the NITK IEEE Student Branch to help first year students get an insight into the Branch events, operations, activities and projects. A  pre-membership talk is held at the beginning of every academic year highlighting the achievements through the previous years while providing a  glimpse of what is planned for the future. Emphasis is laid on the Special Interest Groups (SIGs) and their ongoing projects are featured to help the students choosewhich group they are interested in and likely to work with. The benefits of the IEEE student membership which include better access to IEEE journals and papers along with discounts on Dell laptops and Microsoft downloads are also mentioned. This year our student membership drive was a  huge success, bringing new members to the IEEE family.</p>",
